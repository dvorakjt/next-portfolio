PianoWithAkira.com is a lesson scheduling site created for pianist/educator/YouTuber [Akira Ikegami](https://www.youtube.com/c/AkiraIkegamiChannel). 
The application was created with Next.js and features a custom page-transitions framework that preserves the code-splitting feature of Next.js. 
The site is integrated with [Appointy](https://www.appointy.com/). I customized the look and feel of the Appointy app with CSS so that it matches 
the look and feel of the rest of the site. A separate application was created and rendered in in iframe to detect whether 3rd-party cookies are 
enabled. If they are disabled, the Appointy app opens in a new tab.

The application is deployed to Vercel. AWS Route 53 Health Checks monitor the site and AWS Device Farm was used for testing.
